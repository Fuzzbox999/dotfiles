config.def.h is edited to make use of pywal colors. 
In order to use this build without pywal, replace the following line :

#include "/home/fuzzbox/.cache/wal/colors-wal-dwm.h"

by these lines : 

static const char col_gray1[]       = "#222222";    
static const char col_gray2[]       = "#444444";    
static const char col_gray3[]       = "#bbbbbb";    
static const char col_gray4[]       = "#eeeeee";    
static const char col_cyan[]        = "#005577";    
static const char *colors[][3]      = {    
        /*               fg         bg         border   */    
        [SchemeNorm] = { col_gray3, col_gray1, col_gray2 },    
        [SchemeSel]  = { col_gray4, col_cyan,  col_cyan  },    
};
