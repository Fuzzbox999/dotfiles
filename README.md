# dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository. I use Arch Linux on [Thinkpads](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/) (X220, T430 and T450s), with [i3gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) as a wm, a patched [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) as an app launcher, and [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) along with [wpgtk](https://github.com/BigfootN/wpgtk) as a theme manager, driven from the [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) file manager.

System configuration, software and hardware are intricately linked.
Don't just copy the files because they probably won't work on your system.
Read the files, understand what they do, and do your own stuff.
