# dotfiles

Arch Linux on a Thinkpad, with [i3gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) as a wm, dmenu as an app launcher, and Pywal as a theme manager.

If you intend to use some of my dotfiles, be adviseed that a custom configuration is often complicated; things are intricately linked, so don't just copy the files because they probably won't work on your system. Ricing i3, i3bar or dmenu is really not difficult to achieve. So read te files, understand what they do, be inspired and do your own stuff. If you need a tip, drop me a mail fuzzbox.flc (a) gmail.
