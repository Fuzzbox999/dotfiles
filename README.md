# dotfiles

Hi, this is my dotfiles repository. 

I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) on [Thinkpads](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/) (X220, T430 and T450s), with [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) as a window manager (and previously with [i3gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)), a [patched](https://github.com/Fuzzbox999/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/builds/perso/dmenu-5.0-patched) [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) as an app launcher, [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) as a compositor for Xorg, and [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) along with [wpgtk](https://github.com/BigfootN/wpgtk) as a theme manager, driven from the [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) file manager.
